# Quasi Toeplitz matrix toolbox for MATLAB

The CQT toolbox provides a new MATLAB type that represents semi-infinite
matrices obtained as the sum of a Toeplitz matrix and a finite-dimensional
correction in the top-left corner. 

The arithmetic, plus many additional functions, are implemented in the toolbox. 

To install the latest version in your MATLAB environment you
can run the following commands: 

```Matlab
unzip('https://github.com/numpi/cqt-toolbox/archive/master.zip'); ... 
movefile('cqt-toolbox-master', 'cqt-toolbox'); ... 
addpath(fullfile('cqt-toolbox')); savepath;
```

The latest version, including bug fixes and new features, is available 
at https://github.com/numpi/cqt-toolbox.
